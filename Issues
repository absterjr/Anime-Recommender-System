This Project was made as a part of my course curriculum at the University.

It is an Anime Recommender System that recommends different animes to people based on what the input was given.

The Recommender Systems were made using multiple libraries of Python. 

The API used was Fastapi.

Issues- 

I had to make different APIs for all the different recommenders I made. I need to create an API which contains all of my recommenders in it.
The FrontEnd was made using HTML. It is just a basic version and needs modification to look good.
