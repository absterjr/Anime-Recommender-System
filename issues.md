This Project was made as a part of the course curriculum of my University.
The Python Notebook contains the recommender systems made using different librarires in python.
The API for the different recommenders were made in different .py files.
I was not able to create an api for all the recommenders simultaneously in 1 python file.
Also the Webpage was made using HTML which is just a basic one and needs modifications.
